# Pokedex React App Just for Fun

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a web application built with React that allows users to search and view information about different Pokemon. The application utilizes the PokeAPI to fetch data about each Pokemon, including their name, type, abilities, and stats.

**Getting Started**

To use the Pokedex with React, simply visit the deployed website or clone the repository to your local machine and run "npm install" to install the necessary dependencies. Then run "npm start" to start the development server and access the application in your browser.

**Usage**

Once the Pokedex is loaded, users can search for a specific Pokemon by name or browse through the list of Pokemon alphabetically. Clicking on a Pokemon's name will display its information, including its type, abilities, and stats. The application also includes a filter feature, allowing users to filter Pokemon by their type.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
